 * It was old in the (1998)
 * About 7,000 lines of code <br>

 * Note:<br>
 * It is not that files are big, but <br>
 * The average is (relatively) big; they are larger than other files  <br>
 * <p>
 * -- Think the reason for that is that he Javadoc everything. <br>
 * --- That just drove his file sizes up a little bit  <br>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Note: they are really big, on average <br>

 * Notice:  <br>
 * There's no correlation between  <br>
 * 1. File size and  <br>
 * 2. Distribution <br>
 * ---
 * File size : is not a function of project <br>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * It's a file size, is a style , that you can impose (upon your system).<br>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * What style would you like to impose ? <br>
 * <p>
 * (Since that is ) true, what style would you like to impose  ? <br>
 * <p>
 * How big should your files be?<br>
 * <p>
 * -Build a fairly significant system, with files  <br>
 * That are 50 lines of code, on average  <br>
 * <p>
 * (Most of them are less than 100 lines)  <br>
 * - What a goal to strive for!  </p>
